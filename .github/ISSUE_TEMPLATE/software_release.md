## release prep
- [ ] Pull updated copies of the develop and main branches
- [ ] Use git flow to create a new release branch with the appropriate version (e.g., `git flow release start 0.5`)
- [ ] Review database migrations to make sure updates look good (django only; should be caught in testing/qa)
- [ ] Update release version to appropriate number (for Python apps, set to final version without any `-pre` or `-dev` tags).
- [ ] Update changelog to make sure that all features, changes, bugfixes, etc included in the release are documented.  You may want to review the git revision history to be sure youâ€™ve captured everything.
- [ ] Update deploy notes to document any manual steps that need to be done with the deploy (e.g., running any import scripts, configuring site domain in Django admin, etc)
- [ ] Update any README badges that are pointing to develop branches to use either main or default branch (GitHub Actions workflow status, code coverage, etc).
- [ ] Make sure local settings are documented (for django app: sample local settings file includes any new configurations).
- [ ] Check python requirements for any internal dependencies that should be released (or at least pinned to a specific git commit)
- [ ] Release & publish any internal JS dependencies with updates; specfy the published version number in package.json
- [ ] Use npm audit to check and fix vulnerabilities in npm dependencies
- [ ] Make sure that unit tests and other GitHub Actions workflow checks on are passing on the release branch (fix them if they are not)
- [ ] Make sure code coverage is 95% or higher. Review for any important gaps.
- [ ] Review code documentation to make sure it is up to date. If the database has changed, generate and include current schema documentation images.
- [ ] Run pip freeze, save output as requirements.lock and check in to document known working versions of python dependencies
- [ ] Use git flow to finish the release (merge release branch into both main and develop, create a tag, remove the release branch, etc.). (git flow release finish 0.5)


## after release
- [ ] Increase the develop branch version so it is set to the next expected release (i.e., if you just released 0.5 then develop will probably be 0.6-dev unless you are working on a major update, in which case it will be 1.0-dev)
- [ ] Push all updates to GitHub (main branch, develop branch, tags) 
- [ ] Clean up any release branches on GitHub
